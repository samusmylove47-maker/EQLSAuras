// The anti-constant ratchet, carried across from Session D's repository
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// WHY THESE ARE HERE, AND IT IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE FILE.
//
// `lockoutCore.js` states, in the vendored source: "a hardcoded reset day is forbidden and a test
// fails if one appears." Session D says the same in its own words. IN THIS COPY THAT WAS NOT TRUE.
//
// Measured on 30 August, on a disposable copy: injecting `hour: 11` and `provenance: 'measured'`
// into RESET_RULE produced ZERO new failures here, and SIX in D's own repository. The doctrine was
// enforced there and merely ASSERTED here, because vendoring brought 23 of its 93 tests across and
// the two that are the ratchet were not among them.
//
// That is this project's signature failure — a check whose scope is narrower than the claim it
// appears to defend — arriving inside a module rather than a page. D named the two tests; they are
// carried over verbatim in substance, with the fixture adapted to this suite's helpers.
//
// The rule they enforce: the reset rule may live in exactly ONE place, wearing its provenance, and
// nowhere else. `hour` stays `null` because the owner gave a day and not an hour, and inventing one
// is the failure mode the competitor ships.
