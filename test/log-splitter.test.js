/**
 * The per-day log splitter.
 *
 * It had no suite at all. That is the finding worth keeping from all of this: a shipped module
 * with no tests, whose behaviour when it cannot read a line is to file that line under whatever day
 * it last recognised - quietly, and with nothing counting.
 *
 * That fall-through is CORRECT and it has to stay: EverQuest wraps long server broadcasts onto
 * continuation lines carrying no stamp of their own, and those do belong with the line above.
 * Measured on the owner's real log, it is also almost never used: 1,761,090 lines, TEN unstamped,
 * every one of them a continuation of "we must bring the servers down for a hotfix". Which is what
 * makes the RATE worth watching, and what the last tests here are about.
 *
 * ON THE DAY FORMAT, since these tests exercise it. EverQuest Legends writes "Aug 04" - zero-padded,
 * one space. Measured over every EQ log on this machine, deduplicated by content hash: 34 distinct
 * files, 9,026,690 stamped lines, 1,381,716 of them on days 1 to 9, and the original pattern read
 * every single one correctly. C's ctime() right-aligns instead ("Aug  4"); the two look almost
 * identical, and that resemblance produced a confident claim here that the first nine days of every
 * month were being misfiled. THEY WERE NOT.
 *
 * The pattern now accepts both because the tolerance is free, and the tests below say which of the
 * two they are exercising.
