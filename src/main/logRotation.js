// Weekly log rotation, at the raid lockout reset.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not really about tidiness.
//
// The lockout grid has to answer "have you killed this boss THIS period". Every other tool that
// ships this feature answers it by inferring from kill history and typing a reset day into the
// source. This app can do something better and much simpler: if the live log is archived and
// emptied at the reset boundary, then everything in the live log belongs to the current period
// BY CONSTRUCTION. There is nothing to infer, no boundary arithmetic on individual kills, and no
// hour to be uncertain about.
//
// NOTHING IS DESTROYED. The log is copied to `Logs/Archive/` first, the copy is verified, and only
// then is the original emptied. The owner's whole history stays on disk, in a folder she can open.
//
// WHY TRUNCATE AND NOT DELETE. EverQuest holds the log file open while it is running, and Windows
// will not delete a file with a live handle - but it will let you truncate one to zero length, and
// the game simply carries on appending. `logService.archiveNow()` already chose truncate for this
// reason and this module reuses it wholesale rather than inventing a second mechanism.
// `logWatcher` already handles the result (`stat.size < offset` resets the offset to 0), verified
// by simulating a rotation against the real watcher while it was running.
//
// THE RESET. Tuesday, 11:00, local wall clock - AND THE PROVENANCE OF THAT IS WEAKER THAN THIS
// FILE ORIGINALLY CLAIMED. Read the next paragraph before trusting the number.
//
// This comment used to read "MEASURED RATHER THAN TYPED", on two Alt+Z readings 10.84 h apart that
// landed 6 seconds from each other at 11:00 on Tuesday 1 September 2026. RETRACTED 30 August. What
// those readings establish is an EXPIRY INSTANT for whatever the window's thirty-six rows were.
// They do not establish a reset, a weekly period, or a Tuesday boundary:
//
//   - Sweep the period against the same two readings and 4, 5, 6 AND 7 DAYS are all self-consistent
//     to the same 6 seconds. Only 3 days is excluded. Six days puts the anchor on a WEDNESDAY.
//   - Two readings of one monotonically decreasing counter extrapolate to the same zero BY
//     CONSTRUCTION. The 6-second agreement measures clock drift - 154 ppm - and nothing else.
//   - The 36 rows match `lockoutCore.js:795-804`, which records that window as 28 rows plus 8 rows
//     and calls it object 2 of "THREE DIFFERENT OBJECTS. DO NOT MERGE THEM" - a six-day ROLLING
//     timer with, in its own words, "no weekday and no boundary".
//   - "Every row showed the same time" excludes nothing: `commonOrigin: true` in that same file
//     records 14 locks across 6,133 s of kills rendering one value with zero spread.
//
// `lockoutCore.js:821` labels the same weekday `provenance: 'stated'` with the comment
// "NOT 'measured'. We did not observe this." THAT FILE IS RIGHT AND THIS ONE WAS WRONG.
//
// The number stays because the feature needs one and nothing better exists. It ships DISABLED by
// default, which is doing more work than it was when that default was chosen. HANDOFF.md section 15
// carries the scoring; LOCKOUTS-STATE.md section 5 carries the retraction.
//
// TIME ZONE, stated because it is an assumption and not a measurement. The reading came from a
// machine running Eastern time. Working in LOCAL WALL CLOCK means the boundary self-adjusts across
// the daylight-saving change on 1 November - it stays "11:00 as the clock on the wall reads" - and
// that is the owner's stated expectation. It is correct for a player whose machine is on the same
// clock as the server's reset and wrong by the offset for anyone else. If a non-Eastern user ever
// reports the grid rolling over at the wrong time, THIS COMMENT IS THE REASON and the fix is to
// resolve the boundary through a fixed zone instead.

/**
 * WHERE THE ROTATION ACTUALLY CUTS, which is NOT the reset instant.
 *
 * The reset is Tuesday 11:00 and that is what the archive is named for. But the thing that READS
 * the live log - lockoutCore - starts its period at the boundary DAY, midnight, deliberately:
 * `RESET_RULE.hour` is null and it will not pretend to know an hour it was never given.
 *
 * Cutting at 11:00 therefore removed eleven hours that the grid still considers part of the current
 * period. To the grid that is not "archived", it is a GAP - and a gap under twenty-four hours is
 * TOLERATED, which leaves the cells reading `open` rather than `not looked`. So a boss killed at
 * 08:00 on a Tuesday was archived away and the grid then said, with no hedge at all, that the raid
 * was available. Confidently wrong, in the direction that sends her to re-clear a lockout she
 * already holds - the exact failure this feature exists to prevent.
 *
 * Verified on her real log: the rotation turned a 10.1 h tolerated gap into an 11.0 h tolerated
 * gap, coverage still reported as spanning the period, every cell still `open`. It changed no
 * answer only because she happens not to have raided between midnight and 11:00 in the weeks
 * recorded. That is luck, not a guarantee.
 *
 * Cutting at the day start instead makes the live log hold EXACTLY the core's period. Anything in
 * that ambiguous morning stays where the core can see it, and the core does the honest thing with
 * it: `conditional`, "the reset hour has never been measured". The cost is that the log may retain
 * up to eleven hours of last week - which is precisely what `conditional` is for.

  /**
   * Record a failure, and REMOVE WHATEVER ARCHIVE IT LEFT BEHIND.
   *
   * This is the fix for the worst thing found in this module. Whether a week has been rotated is
   * answered by whether its archive exists - so an attempt that failed halfway and left a file at
   * that path answers "yes, done" for the rest of the week. Every route in was demonstrated: the
   * log grew during the copy, the truncate threw EPERM on a read-only log, the disk filled mid-copy
   * and left a hundred bytes of a one-kilobyte log. In each case the next run reported
   * skippedAlreadyDone, cheerfully, with lastError reading null - and in the third case a fragment
   * had become the permanent archive for that week.
   *
   * A failed rotation must leave NOTHING: no archive, no record, and a visible error. Then the next
   * check a minute later simply tries again.
   *
   * Nothing at that path can belong to anyone else. It did not exist when this file's turn began -
   * that is checked first, and an existing archive means the week is skipped before we get here.
